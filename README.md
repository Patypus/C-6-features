# C-6-features
------

This project is a quick look into the new language features in C# 6. Partly for my own reference when I forget exactly how these things work but mostly as an easy way to play with new toys :)

Each new feature is separated into a different namespace, each of which tries to only look into that particular feature. Inside each namespace is a test class with an nunit test fixture looking into each facaet of the new features to show exactly how each one works. These are setup as unit tests to allow easy debugging to see how everything works.
